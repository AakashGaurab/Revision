## What is Javascript?
JavaScript is a ==dynamic language== with ==dynamic types==. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.

| Data Type   | Description                                                        | Example                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `undefined` | Represents an undefined value.                                     | `let variable;`                  |
| `null`      | Represents the absence of any ==object value==                     | `let variable = null;`           |
| `boolean`   | Represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` or `false`. | `let variable = true;`          |
| `number`    | Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. | `let variable = 42;`             |
| `string`    | Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.             | `let variable = "Hello, World!";` |
| `symbol`    | Represents unique identifiers that are immutable and can be used as property keys. | `let variable = Symbol("description");` |
| `bigint`    | Represents integers with arbitrary precision.                       | `let variable = BigInt(42);`     |
