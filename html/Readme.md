## What is BEM?
- BEM is a way to name and organize CSS classes that helps make your code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. It divides your interface into small, reusable parts called "blocks" that can have "elements" and "modifiers" to change their appearance or behavior. Using BEM makes it easier to create consistent and modular code, and helps you understand how different parts of your interface are related.




## Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements: <header>, <article>,<section>, <footer>
- <header> is used to contain introductory and navigational information about a section of the page. This can include the section heading, the author’s name, time and date of publication, table of contents, or other navigational information.

- <article> is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing its meaning. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.

- <section> is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.

- <footer> is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author’s name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.
