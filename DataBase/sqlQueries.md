### Sql general queries:

#### select data base
    USE db_name

#### Show Databases
    SHOW DATABASES;

#### Create Database
    CREATE DATABASE db_name;

#### Work on a database
    USE db_name;

#### Show Tables
    CREATE TABLE students (name varchar(255),email varchar(50),batch varchar(20));

#### Table Information
    DESCRIBE students;


#### Delete Table
    DROP TABLE students;



# To interchange the values of "male" and "female" in a SQL table, you can use a SQL UPDATE statement with a CASE expression. Here's an example:

sql
Copy code
```
UPDATE your_table_name
SET gender = CASE
    WHEN gender = 'male' THEN 'female'
    WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 'male'
    ELSE gender -- Include this line if you want to handle any other gender values
END;
```
In the above query, replace your_table_name with the actual name of your table, and gender with the name of the column that stores the gender values.

The CASE expression checks the current value of the gender column. If it is 'male', it is updated to 'female', and if it is 'female', it is updated to 'male'. You can add additional WHEN conditions and corresponding updates if you have other gender values to handle. The ELSE clause is optional but can be used to handle any unexpected values or to keep them unchanged.

Here's an example assuming a table called users:

sql
Copy code
```
UPDATE users
SET gender = CASE
    WHEN gender = 'male' THEN 'female'
    WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 'male'
    ELSE gender
END;
```
After executing the query, the values in the gender column will be interchanged between 'male' and 'female' for all rows in the table.

Remember to adapt the table name and column name based on your specific scenario and table structu


#### Reset Table Data
    TRUNCATE TABLE students;

#### Delete Database
    DROP DATABASE db_name;


#### Create Data
    INSERT INTO students ( name, email, batch)VALUES ("e", "e@gmail.com", "xyz");


#### Read Data
    SELECT * FROM students;SELECT name FROM students where name = 'e';


#### Update Data
    UPDATE students SET batch = "Cohort-1" where name = 'e';


#### Delete Data
    DELETE FROM students;
    DELETE FROM students where name = 'e';


### WHERE CLAUSE
- Get all the users 
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data;``

- Get all the users where gender is Male 
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE gender = "Male";``

- Get all the users where gender is not Male 
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE NOT gender = "Male";``
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE gender != "Male";``

-  Get all the users where gender is Male and language is Hindi 
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE gender = "Male" and language = "Hindi";``

- Get all the users where gender is Male and language is not Hindi 
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE gender = "Male" and NOT language = "Hindi";``
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE gender = "Male" and language != "Hindi";``

- Get all the users where shirt size is L or XL 
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE shirt_size = "L" or shirt_size = "XL";``
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE shirt_size IN ("L", "XL");``

- Combining multiple conditions 
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE (gender = "Male" and shirt_size = 'L') OR (gender = "Female" and shirt_size = 'M');``
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE ((gender = "Male" and shirt_size = 'L') OR (gender = "Female" and shirt_size = 'M')) AND language = "English";``
    ``SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE ((gender = "Male" and shirt_size = 'L') OR (gender = "Female" and shirt_size = 'M')) AND language IN ("English", "Hindi");``



### WHERE OPERATORS
``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE maths > 50;``
``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE science >= 75;``
``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE english < 40;``
``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE maths <= 50;``

- Both the starting and ending values are included 
``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE maths BETWEEN 50 AND 75;``



### COUNT FUNCTION
``SELECT COUNT(id) FROM students_marks WHERE gender = 'Male';``
``SELECT COUNT(id) FROM students_marks WHERE maths >= 75;``


### ORDERING RESULTS
``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE gender = 'Male' ORDER BY maths ASC;``
``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE gender = 'Female' ORDER BY science DESC;``
``SELECT * FROM students_marks ORDER BY maths ASC, science DESC;``


### LIMIT & OFFSET
``SELECT * FROM students_marks LIMIT 10;``
- The first value is offset (skip) count the second value is limit count 
``SELECT * FROM students_marks LIMIT 20,10;``


### SUM FUNCTION
``SELECT SUM(maths) FROM students_marks WHERE gender = 'Male';``
``SELECT SUM(maths) FROM students_marks WHERE maths >= 75;``



### AVG FUNCTION
``SELECT AVG(maths) FROM students_marks WHERE gender = 'Male';``
``SELECT AVG(maths) FROM students_marks WHERE maths >= 75;``


### LIKE
- % - Any number or characters
- _ - Single character
    ``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE name LIKE 'a%';``
    ``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE name LIKE '%a';``
    ``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE name LIKE '_a%';``
    ``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE name LIKE '%a_';``
    ``SELECT * FROM students_marks WHERE name LIKE '___a%';``



### DISTINCT
``SELECT DISTINCT company FROM employee_salary;``
``SELECT DISTINCT company, departmement FROM employee_salary;``
``SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company) FROM employee_salary;``


### SUM & AVG
``SELECT AVG(maths) FROM students_marks;``

``SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employee_salary;``

### OPERATIONS
``SELECT (maths+science+english) AS total_marks FROM students_marks;``
``SELECT (maths+science+english)/3 AS avg_marks FROM students_marks;``


### Min & Max
``SELECT MIN(maths) FROM students_marks;``
``SELECT MAX(science) FROM students_marks;``
``SELECT MIN(maths) FROM students_marks WHERE class = "V";``
``SELECT MAX(science) FROM students_marks WHERE gender = "Female";``



### **Grouping**
#### COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG
``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students_marks GROUP BY gender;``
``SELECT COUNT(*), class, section FROM students_marks GROUP BY class, section;``
``SELECT AVG(maths), class, section FROM students_marks GROUP BY class, section;``



### Having
- Filters on aggregation

``SELECT COUNT(*) as num,gender FROM students_marks GROUP BY gender HAVING num < 400;``
``SELECT COUNT(*) as num, class, section FROM students_marks GROUP BY class, section HAVING num > 20;``
``SELECT AVG(maths) as maths_avg, class, section FROM students_marks GROUP BY class, section HAVING maths_avg > 50;``



### Primary Key & Auto Increment
``CREATE TABLE users (id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,name varchar(255) NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY (id));``




### Relationships and Joins
#### joins
``SELECT * FROM blog JOIN user ON blog.user_id = user.id;``
#### RIGHT JOIN
``SELECT * FROM blog RIGHT JOIN user ON blog.user_id = user.id;``
#### LEFT JOIN
``SELECT * FROM blog LEFT JOIN user ON blog.user_id = user.id;``

#### JOIN with as
``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_category as bb right join category as cc on bb.category_id = cc.id where bb.blog_id = 1;``



#### Multiple JOINS
``SELECT * FROM blog join blog_category ON blog.id = blog_category.blog_id JOIN category ON blog_category.category_id = category.id;``
``SELECT aa.title, cc.name, uu.name FROM blog as aa join blog_category as bb ON aa.id = bb.blog_id JOIN category as cc ON bb.category_id =cc.id RIGHT JOIN user as uu ON aa.user_id = uu.id;``
