## What is SQL
    SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. 
    SQL allows users to define, manipulate, and retrieve data from databases. 
    It provides a standard syntax and set of commands for creating, modifying, and querying databases, as well as performing various operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting data. 
    SQL is widely used in database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
    


## what is relational database?
    A relational database is a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes and stores data in a structured manner based on the relational model.
    In a relational database, data is organized into tables, which are composed of rows (also known as records) and columns (also known as fields).
    The tables in a relational database are related to each other through common attributes or keys. 
    These relationships allow data to be linked and retrieved efficiently. 
    The relational model enforces data integrity and provides mechanisms for data manipulation using SQL.
    Relational databases are widely used in various applications and industries due to their flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle complex data relationships. 
    They provide a reliable and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manipulate structured data. Some popular relational database management systems include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.


## what is RDBMS   
    RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It refers to a software application or system that manages and controls a relational database.
    An RDBMS provides the tools and mechanisms for creating, organizing, and manipulating relational databases based on the relational model.
    The main components of an RDBMS include:
        Data Definition Language (DDL): It is used to define the structure of the database, including creating tables, specifying constraints, and defining relationships between tables.
        Data Manipulation Language (DML): It allows users to perform operations on the data stored in the database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records. SQL is the most common language used for DML operations.
        Data Query Language (DQL): It enables users to retrieve data from the database by specifying queries using SQL. DQL is used to search, filter, and sort data based on specified criteria.
        Data Control Language (DCL): It includes commands for managing user access rights, security, and permissions on the database objects. DCL statements are used to grant or revoke privileges to users.
        Transaction Management: An RDBMS supports transaction management to ensure data integrity and consistency. Transactions group a set of database operations and provide mechanisms for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).
    Some popular RDBMS products include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. These systems are widely used for various applications that require reliable and efficient management of structured data.



## What are constraints?
- In the context of databases, constraints are rules or conditions applied to the data in database tables to enforce data integrity and maintain consistency. Constraints define certain restrictions and requirements that the data must adhere to. They help ensure that the data stored in the database meets specific criteria and follows predefined rules.
- Here are some commonly used constraints in SQL:
    - **Primary Key Constraint**: Ensures that a column or a combination of columns in a table uniquely identifies each record. It prevents duplicate or null values in the specified column(s).
    - **Foreign Key Constraint**: Establishes a relationship between two tables, where the values in a column of one table must match the values in the primary key column of another table. It ensures referential integrity.
    - **Unique Constraint**: Ensures that the values in a column or a combination of columns are unique across the table. It prevents duplicate values but allows null values.
    - **Not Null Constraint**: Specifies that a column cannot contain null values. It ensures that the specified column(s) must have a value.
    - **Check Constraint**: Defines a condition that each row in a table must satisfy. It allows you to define custom rules or conditions to restrict the values that can be inserted or updated in a column.
- These constraints are defined when creating or altering a table in SQL. They help maintain data integrity, prevent data inconsistencies, and enforce business rules. When data is inserted, updated, or deleted in the tables, the constraints are checked to ensure the data meets the defined criteria, and if any violation occurs, the database system rejects the operation.
- By using constraints, you can improve the quality and reliability of the data stored in the database, enforce data consistency, and minimize errors or inconsistencies in the data.


## What are primary keys and foreign keys?
- In SQL, primary keys and foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database.
    - **Primary Key**:
        A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It serves as a unique identifier for each row. The primary key constraint ensures that the values in the primary key column(s) are unique and not null. Commonly, a primary key is defined when creating a table using the PRIMARY KEY constraint.
            CREATE TABLE students (
                id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                name VARCHAR(50),
                age INT
                );
    - **Foreign Key**:
        A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, where the foreign key column(s) in one table references the primary key column(s) in another table. The foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity, meaning the values in the foreign key column(s) must match the values in the referenced primary key column(s) or be null.
           ```Sql CREATE TABLE courses (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));
            CREATE TABLE enrollments (
                student_id INT,
                course_id INT,
                FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id),
                FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id)
                );
            ```


## what is table 
- a table is a fundamental structure used to organize and store data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). A table consists of rows (also known as records or tuples) and columns (also known as fields or attributes).
- Each row in a table represents a single instance or record, while each column represents a specific attribute or piece of information associated with the records. The columns are defined with specific data types, such as integers, strings, dates, or other types, to represent the kind of data they can store.
- Tables are organized based on the relational model, which allows relationships to be established between tables through primary key and foreign key constraints. The relationships between tables enable efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and querying using Structured Query Language (SQL).
- Tables form the backbone of a relational database, and data is organized and stored in a structured manner within these tables. They provide a logical and systematic approach to managing and accessing data, allowing for efficient data management and data-driven applications.




## what is difference between alter and update in sql
- **ALTER**:
    - The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of a database object, such as a table, view, or database itself. It allows you to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, indexes, and other structural elements of the database objects. With ALTER, you can make changes to the schema of the database.
- **UPDATE**:
    - The UPDATE command is used to modify the data within a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns in existing rows of a table based on specified conditions. UPDATE is used to update existing records with new values.


## How do you group by?
- In SQL, the GROUP BY clause is used to group rows from a table based on one or more columns. It is often used in combination with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group of rows. The GROUP BY clause helps summarize data and generate results based on common values in the specified columns.
    - SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column)FROM table GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;



## What are joins?
- Joins in SQL are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables as a single result set, enabling you to combine and analyze data from different sources.
- There are different types of joins commonly used in SQL:
    - Inner Join: Returns only the rows where there is a match between the columns being joined in both tables. It excludes unmatched rows from the result set.
    - Left Join (or Left Outer Join): Returns all the rows from the left (or first) table and the matching rows from the right (or second) table. If there are no matches in the right table, NULL values are returned for the right table columns.
    - Right Join (or Right Outer Join): Returns all the rows from the right (or second) table and the matching rows from the left (or first) table. If there are no matches in the left table, NULL values are returned for the left table columns.
    - Full Join (or Full Outer Join): Returns all the rows from both tables and combines them based on the join condition. If there are no matches in either table, NULL values are returned for the columns from the table that has no match.
    - Cross Join (or Cartesian Join): Returns the Cartesian product of the rows from both tables, resulting in a combination of all rows from one table with all rows from the other table. It does not require a join condition.


## what are aggregate function used for?
- Aggregate functions in SQL are used for performing calculations on a set of rows and returning a single value as a result. These functions operate on a group of rows and produce a summarized output. Aggregate functions are commonly used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to perform calculations on grouped data.
- Here are some commonly used aggregate functions in SQL:
    - **COUNT**: Returns the number of rows or non-null values in a specified column.
    - **SUM:** Calculates the sum of the values in a specified column.
    - **AVG**: Calculates the average (mean) of the values in a specified column.
    - **MIN**: Returns the minimum value in a specified column.
    - **MAX**: Returns the maximum value in a specified column.
    - **GROUP_CONCAT**: Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string, optionally separated by a specified delimiter.
- These aggregate functions allow you to obtain useful insights and summaries from data. For example, you can use the COUNT function to count the number of sales transactions, the SUM function to calculate the total revenue, or the AVG function to determine the average salary of employees.
