## What is SQL
    SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL allows users to define, manipulate, and retrieve data from databases. It provides a standard syntax and set of commands for creating, modifying, and querying databases, as well as performing various operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting data. SQL is widely used in database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
    


## what is relational database?
    A relational database is a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes and stores data in a structured manner based on the relational model. In a relational database, data is organized into tables, which are composed of rows (also known as records) and columns (also known as fields).
    The tables in a relational database are related to each other through common attributes or keys. These relationships allow data to be linked and retrieved efficiently. The relational model enforces data integrity and provides mechanisms for data manipulation using SQL.
    Relational databases are widely used in various applications and industries due to their flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle complex data relationships. They provide a reliable and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manipulate structured data. Some popular relational database management systems include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.


## what is RDBMS   
    RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It refers to a software application or system that manages and controls a relational database. An RDBMS provides the tools and mechanisms for creating, organizing, and manipulating relational databases based on the relational model.
    The main components of an RDBMS include:
        Data Definition Language (DDL): It is used to define the structure of the database, including creating tables, specifying constraints, and defining relationships between tables.
        Data Manipulation Language (DML): It allows users to perform operations on the data stored in the database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records. SQL is the most common language used for DML operations.
        Data Query Language (DQL): It enables users to retrieve data from the database by specifying queries using SQL. DQL is used to search, filter, and sort data based on specified criteria.
        Data Control Language (DCL): It includes commands for managing user access rights, security, and permissions on the database objects. DCL statements are used to grant or revoke privileges to users.
        Transaction Management: An RDBMS supports transaction management to ensure data integrity and consistency. Transactions group a set of database operations and provide mechanisms for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).
    Some popular RDBMS products include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. These systems are widely used for various applications that require reliable and efficient management of structured data.
